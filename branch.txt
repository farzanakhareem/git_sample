At the top of the file list, locate the Branch drop-down menu. (By default, the menu displays Branch: main.) Click the drop-down menu, type the name of the branch you want to create, and press Enter or return on your keyboard.
Your repository now has two branches: Main and Child_Branch. You can click the drop-down menu to see your branches.
Any files that were in the main branch are reflected in the Child_Branch. Note that when you add or edit a file in Child_Branch, that change will not automatically reflect in the main branch.
The file that you added to your child branch is not automatically added to the main branch. (You can check this by using the Branch drop-down menu to go to the main branch; note that there is no testchild.py file in the file list).
